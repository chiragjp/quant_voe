# quantvoe: Evaluating model robustness though vibration of effects

## Introduction

When computing any association between an X and an Y variable -- like coffee and heart attacks, 
wine and mortality, or weight and type 2 diabetes onset, different modeling strategies can 
often yield different results. We refer to this as "vibration of effects," and it permeates 
any field that uses observational data (which is most fields). We build this package to model 
vibration of effects, fitting hundreds, thousands, potentially millions of models to show 
exactly how consistent an association output is. Quant_voe can be used for everything from 
clinical to economic data to tackle this problem, moving observational data science towards 
consistent reproducibility.

## Installation

To install the most recent development version, install and use R's devtools package:
```
#if devtools is not already installed, do so with install.packages()
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github("chiragjp/quantvoe")
```
To build from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/chiragjp/quantvoe.git
R CMD build /path/to/quantvoe/repository/
R CMD install quantvoe_0.1.0.tar.gz
```

We are in the process of submitting to CRAN, and expect it to be accessible through `install.packages('quantvoe')` shortly.
